# Loan Default Prediction using SVM Model

## Overview

This project involves building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict loan defaults using R. The model is trained on historical loan data, which includes various features such as loan amount, borrower credit score, employment status, and more. The objective is to classify whether a loan will default (1) or not (0).

### Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script in R to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

### Training the Model

Train the SVM model using the preprocessed data.

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model to check its performance on test data.

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new loan data.

## Notes

Ensure you have R environment properly set up with necessary libraries installed as per the scripts in 'loan_SVM.R'.
